    Film, also called movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories,
    perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely,
    other sensory stimulations.The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to
    the art form that is the result of it.

    The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models
    using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other
    visual effects

    Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film stock through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen.
    Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical
    form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images which
    runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).

    Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form,
    a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication.
    Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages.

    The name "film" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures.
    Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay, and flick. The most common term in the United States
    is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies, and cinema; the last of these is
    commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.
